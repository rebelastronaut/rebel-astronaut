"VR, AI, Quantum Computing - It can be unnerving how much is changing all at once. It’s like progress is swirling all around you, a heavy current that’s hard to keep on top of.

But what if you were in on the formula to surf these waves, rather than getting dragged under?

Welcome to Launchpad’s first exploration!

Our journey will be split into two parts - two talks (the format you know and love) but with interactive sessions between them to collaborate, chat and dive deeper on each topic with a smaller breakout group.

First off, join Giles to explore the macroeconomic shifts that define progress in our industry both now and in the future, learning about the previous 5 tidal waves that changed the face of our world economy. Next, delve into how we can navigate infinite future waves that come to keep moving towards successful transformation.

After, we’ll hand over to you to put the formula into practice in your groups, exploring current change vs waves beyond our life spans, before rounding off with Grant - here to guide you through these waters by demonstrating that when it comes to strategy, even the dictionary has it wrong.

Join us at 6:30pm on June 6th for Launchpad’s first tour!"

"Ah, software delivery. Sometimes it feels like trying to untangle a headphone cord blindfolded. With gloves on.

But indicators like DORA metrics should help navigate the mess right? You'd think, but finding your way in a complex system includes more elements than you realise.

Presenting the guide you didn't know you were missing, Matthew Skelton will be talking over key techniques to improve your flow of delivery including:

Independent Service Heuristics (ISH)
User Needs Mapping (UNM)
DORA Metrics
Flow Efficiency
Oh, and for those thinking, "But I'm not in IT!" â€“ Turns out industries everywhere, from law to healthcare, are realising they've got their own tangles to deal with, and ultimately Fast Flow Organisations are needed in every sector.

Ready to swap out that 'forever tangled' model for a streamlined flow? Pull up a chair, this is the masterclass on untangling you've always needed!

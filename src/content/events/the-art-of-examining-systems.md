"Welcome to Launchpad’s second event, because who doesn’t love a sequel?

This time we launch with Simon, here to talk through how adopting new tech can offer advantages, but translating these into bottom-line benefits can require challenging the rules that govern your organisation. Simon will illustrate this idea using a real-world example, demonstrating that technology’s real benefits can only be unleashed when it is treated as part of a wider system.

Next, we’ll hand over to you for some group detective work, exploring a scenario to organise system level symptoms into cause and effect maps to reveal the elusive root of a problem.

So buckle up for this blockbuster event. We're talking a sequel that could give 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' a run for its money, or at the very least, a contender to 'Toy Story 2’."

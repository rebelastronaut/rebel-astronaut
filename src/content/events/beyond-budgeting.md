What could be less agile than an elephant? 🐘

A budget.

And when it comes to transformation, budgeting isn't just the elephant in the room— it's the metaphorical megaherbivore that tramples your innovation hopes into the dirt.

So what can you do about it?

Join us on 5th December when @bjartebogsnes will delve deep into:

1. 𝗚𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗕𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Understand the inefficiencies of outdated budgeting processes and how they stifle agility and innovation in the modern business landscape.

2. 𝗦𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗣𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲𝘀: Dive into the difference between aspirations (targets), expectations (forecasts), and resource optimization, and discover how separating these can drastically improve each process.

3. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗔𝗴𝗶𝗹𝗲: Explore the fundamental conflicts between traditional corporate processes and the agile philosophy, and learn how to bridge this gap for more streamlined and efficient operations.
Don't let your budget be the behemoth that stands in the way of transformation. Learn the strategies, tools, and mindsets that can make a difference.

"Navigating complexity can feel like uncharted waters, and for years the Cynefin framework has acted as a compass for finding a direction through the unknown.

But if complexity is like unknown waters, why not learn from the flow itself?

In this session, Dave Snowden will do just that, drawing parallels between the intricate, multiple flows of possibility in a system and the dynamic nature of an estuary.

Mark your calendars for November 7th and join us as Dave leads a deep dive into Estuarine Mapping, guiding you through the logical flow beyond Cynefin, and empowering you to turn the tide of your transformation.

Whew that was a lot of water word play ðŸŒŠ

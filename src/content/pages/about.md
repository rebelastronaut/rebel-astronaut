Its mission is to prepare the world for a new Golden Age of Technology. To focus on the unique qualities that make us human and empower others to use these tools to create a better world for all mankind. 

We believe that as technology becomes more powerful, humanity will need to double down on creativity or get swept away. For so long, we’ve been doing our best at being machines, now we need to lean into what makes us unique as humans to succeed. 

Rebel Astronaut aims to create a space where the Rebels (creatives) and the Astronauts (scientists) can come together to navigate a path to a better society. Focusing not on technology but on how we use it, what we do with it, and how it can empower our lives. 

Because seriously, what is the point of technology if it doesn’t make things better for everyone?

Bringing our own brand of rebelliousness, we intend to:
Create space for discussion and community.
Develop boot camps and training courses.
Pioneer and share a constellation of productivity tools.
Work with leaders to support the way they transform their organisations.

It’s in bringing people together that we will make real change, so join us as we explore the future of technology, in doing so, define the future of humanity. 

Together we can navigate these changes, redefine the status quo and boldly go where no Astronaut (rebellious or not) has gone before.
